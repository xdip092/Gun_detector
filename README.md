# `gun.py` is a Python script designed to simulate a gun-like behavior, allowing users to fire virtual bullets and track their trajectory. The script utilizes Python's built-in libraries to handle the simulation, providing a simple yet effective way to visualize and analyze the movement of the bullets.

The script includes features such as customizable bullet speed and angle, as well as the ability to display the trajectory of the bullets on a graphical interface. This tool can be useful for educational purposes, such as demonstrating basic physics concepts like trajectory and velocity.
